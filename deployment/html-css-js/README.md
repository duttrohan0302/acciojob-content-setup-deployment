# Deployment

## HTML-CSS-JS Deployment
- Push code to github
- Go to repo settings
- Click on Pages
- Click on Deploy from branch (Select the branch - usually master) and click on save
- Your default domain would be your_github_username.github.io
- Now, come back to github code
- Go to the html file you want to open and copy the path in the browser url other than blob/master
- E.g. let's say your github username is abcd and your file.html path is repofolder/first/second/file.html
- So your deployed link will be abcd.github.io/repofolder/first/second/file.html
- It takes a few mins to get the deployed page
- If your html file name is index.html then you dont need to add that in the url
